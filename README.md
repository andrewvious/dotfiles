# 🧊 My NixOS Configuration

This repository contains my personal NixOS system configuration using [flakes](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes) and [home-manager](https://nix-community.github.io/home-manager/).

It includes everything I use for:
- 💻 Software Development
- 📡 Communication
- 🎬 Media consumption
- 🎮 Gaming
- ⚙️ Anything else I find useful for my system

## ⚡️ What’s a Nix Flake?

A *flake* is a standardized way to define and manage Nix-based configurations. It makes systems:
- Reproducible
- Composable
- Version-controlled

This repo uses flakes to pin versions of Nix packages and declaratively configure both system and user environments, all of which can be found here in my dotfiles.
